# Platformer Game

Made with the LÃ–VE 2D game engine

Game includes:

- Saveable progress: The application will remember what level you reached and load you back to that level when starting a new session.
- Audio: Unique Collecting and Jumping sounds
- Animation: Animations for player functionality, enemy movement (Dynamic based on individual entity stats) and level flags
- Physics: Using a love2d physics wrapper, the game features accurate collisions with interactable objects and the world around the player.

Collision, Entity and general GameData is created through Tiled, making it very easy to make adjustments to enemy locations, collisions and world structure.
